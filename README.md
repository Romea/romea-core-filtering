# romea_core_filtering #

This project is a **header-only library** that provides tools for setting up asynchronous data fusion using **Kalman filters** or **particle filters**. It is an integral part of the **ROMEA robotics ecosystem**, enabling enhanced sensor data integration and estimation capabilities.

## **Usage**

1. create a ROS workspace
2. cd worskpace
3. mkdir src
4. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Romea/romea-core-filtering/refs/heads/main/romea_filtering_public.repos
5. vcs import src < romea_filter_public.repos
6. build packages
   - catkin build for ROS1
   - colcon build for ROS2
7. create your application using this library
